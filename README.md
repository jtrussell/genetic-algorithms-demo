# Genetic Algorithms Demo

A basic GA implementation using built in modules.


## Demos

Each of our demos use bit strings (1s and 0s) to represent individuals of a
population.

- `exp_alt_digits.py`: More fit individuals have bit strings with alternating 1s
  and 0s.
- `exp_sum_digits.py`: More fit individual have bit strings with more 1s. As a
  kicker, a string of all 0s gets the best score.
